## System Requirements

Check out the [Systems Requirements reference](https://docs.daydream.live/scope/reference/system-requirements).

## Quick Start

Check out the [Quick Start](https://docs.daydream.live/scope/getting-started/quickstart).

## Runpod

Check out the [instructions](https://docs.daydream.live/scope/getting-started/quickstart#cloud-runpod) for deploying Scope on Runpod using a template.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The template will store model files under `/workspace/models` because RunPod mounts a volume disk at `/workspace` allowing any files there to be retained across pod restarts.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use the version from the main branch, you need to use the `daydreamlive/scope:main` docker image. You can configure this in the RunPod template by editing the Docker image setting.

## Firewalls

If you run Scope in a cloud environment with restrictive firewall settings (eg. Runpod), Scope supports using [TURN servers](https://webrtc.org/getting-started/turn-server) to establish a connection between your browser and the streaming server.

The easiest way to enable this feature is to follow the [HuggingFace Auth guide](https://docs.daydream.live/scope/guides/huggingface) which walks through using a HuggingFace account to access Cloudflare's TURN servers.

## Environment Variables

Check out the [Environment Variables reference](https://docs.daydream.live/scope/reference/environment-variables).

## Token Radius Attention

Optional training-free attention sparsity for the Wan2.1-family diffusion backbones (LongLive, MemFlow, RewardForcing, Krea Realtime Video, StreamDiffusionV2). Each query's attention entropy is mapped to a per-token key budget, which becomes a temporally decayed key radius — queries attend to a query-centred neighbourhood instead of every key. Set `WAN_TOKEN_RADIUS=1` to opt in, and `WAN_TOKEN_RADIUS_MAX_DENSITY` (default `0.19`) to cap the retained key fraction. Sequences shorter than 512 keys fall back to the usual dense backend. Adapted from [Token Radius Attention for Efficient Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.02504v1).
